## Chaos.m
  This script will collect user input and then display a visual playing of the [Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game         "Chaos Game Wiki"). 
  The game is played by choosing a point at random within an equilateral triangle, then randomly choosing a vertex, and moving 1/3 of the
  way closer to it. The process leads to an interesting fractal structure at the end. Run the script to find out which one! 

## Chaos4.m
  This script is similar to the chaos.m script and is also a a visual playing of the [Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game   "Chaos Game WIki"). 
  This time however, 4 verticies are used instead and the the points are moved 1/4th closer towards a vertex instead. The process leads
  to an interesting fractal structure at the end. Run the script to find out which one!  

## Sierpinski.m
  This script will collct user input and will display a animation up to that iteration of [Sierpinski's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle "Sierpinski's Trinagle Wiki"). 
  Here is a visual image of what the fractal looks like at   a high number of iterations. The script uses a different color with each
  iteration to show the particular triangles that are removed at   each stage.
